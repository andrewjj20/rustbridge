#  RustBridge website

Necessary parts of the RustBridge website

1) Landing page with statements of intention and currently running workshops
2) Workshop material pages that can host multiple guides
3) Template for individual workshop: contact, application process, etc.
4) Link to the rustfest team for people interested in running a RustBridge

Examples: http://www.clojurebridge.org/, http://www.railsbridge.org/

In a second phase probably: space for learners groups to organise themselves, maybe an adoption of https://rorganize.it/?
