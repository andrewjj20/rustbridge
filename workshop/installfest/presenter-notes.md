# RustBridge InstallFest: Presenter Notes

## macOS

* Spotlight is used to find Terminal.
  Activated by clicking the menu bar item, hitting command-space.
* Very default looking terminal prompt:
      Last login: Some Date on console
      Janes-MacBookPro:~ jane$ [cursor]
* Demonstrate terminal by telling people to type `echo hello` and see the respond.
* curl is installed on macOS by default so the user should have it.
* Explain "WARNING: This is beta software" if it makes people nervous.
* What happens if there are errors when installing rustup/rust? e.g. network trouble, server down
* Make sure people are typing `rustc` to test it and not `rust`.
* Define terms as they are introduced.
* Explain how installing rustc/cargo is the same as installing a desktop app, but you only interact with it from the terminal and there is no "app icon" and nothing appears on your dock/launch bar.
