# Project

This project is a URL shortener (think Bitly) designed and build in such a
way that it serves as a well documented example of how to design and
build a Rust project.

The URL shortener will:

* Take requests for shortened URLs (e.g. shrt.com/abcd)
and will redirect the user to a longer, ugly URL.
  * Count and persist the number of redirects.
* Provide a simple web interface to add URLs to the database.
