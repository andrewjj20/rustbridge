RustBridge Workshops
====================

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/) is a programming language designed to allow for a high level of control and performance in software development. Learning Rust will show you the beauty in the foundations of computing systems. [RustBridge](README.md) workshops create a fluent first experience, step by step making you more aware of the complexities behind the scenes of information technology.
