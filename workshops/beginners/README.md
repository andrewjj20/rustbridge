# Making images with Rust

## Step 1: Single-color image

[This program](01_single_color_image) always makes a 400x400 image filled with red.

## Step 2: Simple image with multiple colors

[This program](02_simple_image) always makes the same multi-colored image below.

## Step 3: Image with randomly picked colors

[This program](03_random_image) makes an image with squares of red, blue, green, and black, picked
randomly. You'll get a different image every time you run it.
