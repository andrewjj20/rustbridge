Image generation
================

We're going to use Rust to build an image-generation program. This program will automatically generate
images in the style of Ellsworth Kelly's painting [Spectrum Colors Arranged by Chance](https://www.sfmoma.org/artwork/99.352).
This is a fairly straightforward programming exercise that you could do in many different programming languages.


What you already know
---------------------

For this tutorial, we are assuming that you've already written and successfully compiled some Rust programs before.
If you haven't, try taking a look at tutorials like (link to tutorial) first before attempting this one.
